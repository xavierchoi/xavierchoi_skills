Real examples showing how simple requests transform into expert-informed prompts.

---

## Example 1: Blog Post Request

### Original Request
> "Write a blog post about productivity"

### Expert Discovery
**Discovered experts via web search:**

1. **Cal Newport** - Computer science professor, author of "Deep Work"
   - Known for: Deep work methodology, digital minimalism
   - Approach: Focus on high-value activities, eliminate distractions

2. **James Clear** - Author of "Atomic Habits"
   - Known for: Habit formation, 1% improvement philosophy
   - Approach: Systems over goals, environment design

3. **David Allen** - Creator of Getting Things Done (GTD)
   - Known for: GTD methodology, stress-free productivity
   - Approach: Capture everything, clear the mind, next actions

### User Selected: Cal Newport

### Enhanced Prompt
```
## Enhanced Prompt (Based on Cal Newport's Deep Work Methodology)

### Context
Create a blog post that challenges the prevailing narrative of "productivity hacks"
and constant connectivity. The audience consists of knowledge workers who feel
overwhelmed by shallow work and struggle to produce meaningful output.

### Task
Write a 1,500-word article that introduces the concept of deep work as a
competitive advantage in the modern economy, contrasting it with the prevalent
culture of busyness.

### Approach (Following Newport's Framework)
1. **Opening**: Start with a counterintuitive observation about how the most
   productive people often seem to work less (visible) hours
2. **Problem definition**: Describe the "shallow work" trap using Newport's
   terminology - the constant emails, meetings, and context-switching
3. **Core argument**: Present deep work as a skill that can be trained, using
   Newport's evidence from high performers
4. **Practical framework**: Introduce one specific deep work protocol
   (e.g., time-blocking or the shutdown ritual)
5. **Call to action**: End with a concrete first step the reader can take tomorrow

### Quality Criteria (Newport's Standards)
- No generic "5 tips" listicle format
- Must include specific, actionable protocols, not vague advice
- Should challenge conventional productivity wisdom
- Cite research or real-world examples to support claims
- Avoid clichés about "hustle culture" or "work-life balance"

### Expected Output
A thought-leadership article that positions the reader as someone who understands
a deeper truth about productivity. Tone should be intellectual but accessible,
similar to Newport's blog style. The reader should finish with a changed perspective
and one clear action to implement.

## Example 2: Presentation Help

### Original Request
> "Help me with my sales presentation"

### Expert Discovery
**Discovered experts via web search:**

1. **Nancy Duarte** - Presentation design expert, author of "Slide:ology"
   - Known for: Visual storytelling, "sparkline" structure
   - Approach: Contrast between what is and what could be

2. **Carmine Gallo** - Communication coach, author of "Talk Like TED"
   - Known for: TED-style presentations, rule of three
   - Approach: Emotional connection, memorable moments

3. **Oren Klaff** - Author of "Pitch Anything"
   - Known for: STRONG method, frame control
   - Approach: Neuroscience-based pitching, status dynamics

### User Selected: Nancy Duarte

### Enhanced Prompt
```
## Enhanced Prompt (Based on Nancy Duarte's Presentation Framework)

### Context
Develop a sales presentation using Duarte's "sparkline" methodology, which
creates persuasive narrative tension by contrasting the current state ("what is")
with the future possibility ("what could be").

### Task
Structure a presentation that guides the audience on an emotional journey from
recognizing their current pain to envisioning success with your solution.

### Approach (Following Duarte's Sparkline)
1. **Opening**: Establish common ground - acknowledge where the audience is today
2. **Contrast #1**: Paint the "what is" (current challenges) vs. "what could be"
   (potential with solution)
3. **Middle journey**: Alternate between problems and possibilities, building tension
4. **Turning point**: The moment of realization - why change is necessary now
5. **New bliss**: Vision of success - what their world looks like after adoption
6. **Call to adventure**: Clear next step that begins the transformation

### Quality Criteria (Duarte's Standards)
- One key message per slide
- Visual-first design - slides should be understood in 3 seconds
- No bullet-point walls - use images and minimal text
- Include a "STAR moment" - Something They'll Always Remember
- Presentation should work even without the speaker (visual clarity)

### Deliverables
- Slide deck outline with speaker notes for each slide
- Identification of the single most important "STAR moment"
- Suggested visuals/imagery for key transitions
- Timing guidance (Duarte recommends: 10% opening, 80% journey, 10% call to action)

### Expected Outcome
A presentation that doesn't just inform but transforms - moving the audience
from passive listeners to active believers ready to take the next step.

## Example 3: Marketing Strategy

### Original Request
> "Give me marketing ideas for my app"

### Expert Discovery
**Discovered experts via web search:**

1. **Seth Godin** - Marketing thought leader, author of "Purple Cow"
   - Known for: Remarkable products, permission marketing
   - Approach: Be remarkable or invisible, tribe building

2. **Sean Ellis** - Coined "growth hacking", founder of GrowthHackers
   - Known for: AARRR funnel, product-market fit survey
   - Approach: Data-driven experimentation, viral loops

3. **April Dunford** - Positioning expert, author of "Obviously Awesome"
   - Known for: Positioning methodology, competitive alternatives
   - Approach: Context setting, differentiation clarity

### User Selected: Sean Ellis

### Enhanced Prompt
```
## Enhanced Prompt (Based on Sean Ellis's Growth Hacking Framework)

### Context
Develop a growth strategy for your app using Ellis's data-driven,
experimentation-focused methodology. This approach prioritizes finding scalable,
repeatable acquisition channels through rapid testing.

### Task
Create a 90-day growth experiment roadmap that systematically tests acquisition
channels and optimizes the user funnel.

### Approach (Following Ellis's AARRR Framework)
Analyze and optimize each stage:

**1. Acquisition**
- List 10 potential acquisition channels
- Prioritize using ICE scoring (Impact, Confidence, Ease)
- Design 3 rapid experiments for top channels
- Define success metrics and minimum viable tests

**2. Activation**
- Map the current "aha moment" - when users first experience value
- Identify drop-off points between signup and activation
- Design 3 experiments to improve activation rate
- Target: [X]% of new users reach activation within [Y] days

**3. Retention**
- Analyze cohort retention curves
- Identify what retained users do differently
- Design experiments to replicate successful behaviors
- Define target retention rates by week/month

**4. Revenue** (if applicable)
- Map current monetization touchpoints
- Test pricing, packaging, or timing variations
- Design 2-3 monetization experiments

**5. Referral**
- Identify natural sharing moments in the product
- Design viral loop experiments
- Calculate current viral coefficient and target improvement

### Quality Criteria (Ellis's Standards)
- Every experiment must have a falsifiable hypothesis
- Define success metrics BEFORE running tests
- Achieve statistical significance before declaring winners
- Document learnings from failed experiments (often most valuable)
- Focus on "North Star Metric" alignment

### Deliverables
- 90-day experiment roadmap with prioritized tests
- Tracking dashboard requirements
- Weekly experiment velocity targets (Ellis recommends 2-3 tests/week)
- Decision framework for scaling winning experiments

### Expected Outcome
A systematic, data-driven approach to growth that replaces guesswork with
validated learning, identifying 2-3 scalable channels within 90 days.
