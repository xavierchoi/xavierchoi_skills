### Universal Quality Markers

3. **Standards**: Explicit quality criteria
4. **Scope**: Defined boundaries and deliverables
5. **Success metrics**: How to evaluate the output

### Combining Multiple Experts

When user selects multiple perspectives:

1. Identify complementary aspects of each expert's approach
2. Layer frameworks (e.g., content structure from one, voice from another)
3. Note where experts might conflict and ask user to prioritize
4. Create unified prompt that honors each contribution

### Adapting Expert Wisdom

Expert frameworks must be adapted to:

- User's actual constraints (time, resources, skill level)
- Specific context of the request
- Scale of the task (full project vs. quick task)
- Available tools and platforms
