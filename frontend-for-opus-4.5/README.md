# Frontend Design Skill for Opus 4.5

Generates distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Optimized for Claude Opus 4.5.

## What It Does

Claude automatically uses this skill for frontend work. Creates production-ready code with:

- Bold, committed aesthetic direction (Art Director mindset)
- Distinctive typography with intentional font pairing
- Tactile depth that eliminates the "plastic AI look"
- High-impact animations focused on key moments
- Context-aware implementation that stays within scope

## Usage
```
"Create a dashboard for a music streaming app"
"Build a landing page for an AI security startup"
"Design a settings panel with dark mode"
```

Claude will choose a clear aesthetic direction and implement production code with meticulous attention to detail.

## Opus 4.5 Optimizations

- Removed "think" terminology (sensitivity issue when extended thinking is disabled)
- Softened emphatic language (CRITICAL, NEVER) — Opus 4.5 follows instructions without aggressive phrasing
- Added over-engineering prevention ("Stay within scope" principle)
